# Autonomous-Lane-Detection
This project is a vision-based system that combines lane detection with simulated obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles. It processes video frames in real-time to detect road lanes and simulates ultrasonic-based object detection for improved driving safety.

🧠 Overview
Autonomous navigation systems must understand the driving environment to make intelligent decisions. This project mimics key features found in self-driving vehicles:

Detecting lanes using edge and Hough line transformation

Simulating obstacle detection with distance measurement

Overlaying results directly onto the video frame

Ideal for understanding the basics of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems).
